<h2>📺 KPU Tutor Training Videos on YouTube</h2>

As part of my role as senior peer tutor at Kwantlen Polytechnic University, I helped run group seminars and create resourses to train up and coming tutors. An example of how I organized my time throughout a semester was published as an image in a book called UNIVERSITY 101: STUDY, STRATEGIZE AND SUCCEED. This was a reasourse for students to help them succeed in university. Additionally, I helped to create two peer tutor training videos shared below.
